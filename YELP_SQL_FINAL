Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
# Code for the Assignment
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Table
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.
# Code for Question 2
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(key)) FROM Table
i. Business = id: 10000
ii. Hours = business_id: 1562
iii. Category = business_id: 2643
iv. Attribute = business_id: 1115
v. Review = id: 10000; user_id: 9581; business_id: 8090
vi. Checkin = business_id: 493
vii. Photo = id: 10000; business_id: 6493
viii. Tip = user_id: 537; business_id: 3979
ix. User = id: 10000
x. Friend = user_id: 11
xi. Elite_years = user_id: 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: No

		| Sara   |         1629 |
		| Yuri   |         1339 |
		+--------+--------------+		


8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	When looking at the number at the top they have almost 1000 reviews less.
	From their it is consistently reviewers with a bit over 1000 reviews that have the most fans.
	The only outlier being Gerald in 2nd with 2000

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer:
	There are 1780 reviews that use the word love vs. 232 hate reviews
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	SELECT COUNT(text)
	FROM review
	WHERE text LIKE '%love%'
	SELECT COUNT(text)
	FROM review
	WHERE text LIKE '%hate%'
	
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:
I used the same code
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	SELECT name, fans, review_count
	FROM user
	ORDER BY fans
	DESC
	LIMIT 10
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:

			+-----------+--------------+------+
			| Name      | review_count | Fans |

			+-----------+--------------+------+
		

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	I picked aurora
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
	The two groups don't have hours listed for any store.
	What I did find was that the higher reviewed stores have more reviews.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
        What I did find was that the higher reviewed stores have more reviews. 
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
	It is hard to tell the location so I looked at the postal codes for the city.
	The highest number of stores corresponded to L4G.
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT name, address, stars, review_count, is_open, postal_code
FROM business 
WHERE CITY like '%Aurora%'
GROUP BY stars
ORDER BY stars DESC
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
	For this part I switched to a different city: Toronto because it had more stores and ones that were closed as well.	
i. Difference 1:
   There are many more stores that are open than closed.      
         
ii. Difference 2:
   Both closed resturaunts are in the same postal code M5B
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT name, address, stars, review_count, is_open, postal_code
FROM business 
WHERE CITY like '%Toronto%'
GROUP BY stars
ORDER BY is_open DESC
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
    I will look at whether good resturants are grouped together or not.
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
    I will use the same data set of reviews that I already have access to.
    I will use that see if there is a correlation between the rating of resturants and their City. In essence I want to find what cities have the most 5 star resturants.                      
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
